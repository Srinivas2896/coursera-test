	Never blame anyone in life.
	<br>Good people give happiness.
	<br>Bad people give you experience.
	<br>Worst people give you lesson and
	<br>best people give you memories.
<br>.....It's you to decide to whom you want to live with.

		Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.They somehow already know what you truly want to become.Everything else is secondary.

		When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life.When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.I wrote down 'happy'.They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life. </div>
